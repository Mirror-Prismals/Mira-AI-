Introducing Mira AI, a small language model and ethically sourced corpus. This implmentation uses stock GPT2 training scripts, but the real star of the show is the 28k word corpus which I wrote myself. It's a collection of inputs ive sent to various frontier large language models.
How to train your own model
1. download the training script and corpus
2. change the path in the training script to point to the corpus folder
3. run in an ide/terminal after installing python and the required pip packages.
